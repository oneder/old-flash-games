<h2>How to play:</h2>
<p>
Since Adobe has ended any and all support for Flash, Flash games are no longer playable directly in the browser :( Luckily, Adobe's <i>Flash Player projector content debugger</i> can be used to play Flash <i>swf</i> files, so these games can live on :)
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download <i>swf</i> files
  <li>Install Adobe's <i>Flash Player projector content debugger </i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220401020702/https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html" target="_blank">here</a></li>
  <li>Open the <i>Flash Player projector content debugger</i> and then, <i>File</i> > <i>Open...</i>, select swf file to open and click OK
</ul>

Each game should have in-game instructions, or be simple enough to figure out the controls.
